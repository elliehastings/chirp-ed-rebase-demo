# Smaug

Smaug was a powerful and fearsome dragon living in the Kingdom of Erebor on Middle-earth. He invaded Erebor 150 years prior to the events described in Bilbo Baggins's epic adventure, There And Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale. A group of thirteen dwarves mounted a quest to take the kingdom back, aided by the wizard Gandalf and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Smaug was described by Thorin Oakenshield as "a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm".

Smaug is rumored to have one weak spot, a bare patch on his belly.
